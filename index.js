/**
 * Normally I'd use VueJS or Angular for my client side app's, especially if reactivity and feeling quick is important.
 * However, since this just a basic example I don't want to go through the process of setting up an entire build system to compile my vue modules and es6
 * and give you a bunch of build steps to run.
 * Instead everything is brought in through CDN's and can run once index.html is opened in a browser.
 * Minimal overhead was part of my goal here.
